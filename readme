BPMDetect is automatic BPM (beats per minute) detection utility.
It uses SounTouch's BPM library for detecting BPMs, TagLib for reading and writing BPMs
to tags and Qt4 for GUI. Aditional libraries (mad, vorbisfile, FLAC, FMOD) are used for
decoding and FMOD is also used for audio output (testing BPMs).
All libraries are optional.

You can download FMOD Ex audio library from http://www.fmod.org
