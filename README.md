# BPMDetect

BPMDetect is automatic BPM (beats per minute) detection utility.

It uses SoundTouch's BPM library for detecting BPMs, TagLib for reading and writing BPMs to tags and Qt 5 for the GUI. Aditional libraries (mad, vorbisfile, FLAC, FMOD) are used for decoding and FMOD is also used for audio output (testing BPMs).

All libraries are optional.

You can download FMOD Ex audio library from [http://www.fmod.org](http://www.fmod.org).
