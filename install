REQUIREMENTS
------------

* A Python interpreter and SCons (0.96 or newer) for compilation
* QT3 for GUI
* ID3lib
* TagLib
* FMOD Ex

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

For configuring, compiling and installing the application just run:

$ scons
$ scons install (as root user)

ADVANCED BUILD FEATURES & DEINSTALLING
--------------------------------------

In case you want to execute many compilation jobs in parallel (because you
want to make use of a SMP system or a compile cluster, for instance),
you can use ('N' is the number of jobs which should be run in parallel):

$ scons -jN

A debug build of the program can be created by running:

$ scons configure debug=1
$ scons

Finally, the software can be removed from your system by running

$ scons -c install

CONFIGURATION NOTES
-------------------

The installation scripts are relying on the kde-config program.
The programs kde-config, qmake, uic and moc must be accesssible
through your PATH.

Qt and kde may not be installed as expected (in QTDIR and KDEDIR)
So until kde-config is able to give that information, you may
have to give those paths. You may also want to tune the build.

In these cases, you must first run "scons configure" with some options
before running "scons" and "scons install"

Here are some examples :
$   scons configure qtincludes=/usr/include/qt/
To install in some particular location with additional include paths
$   scons configure prefix=~/tmp extraincludes=/tmp/include:/usr/local/include
For AMD64 and platforms where folders are like /usr/lib64
$   scons configure libsuffix=64

For more options, run
scons --help
